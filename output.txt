PROJECTS
Finance AI Expert Chatbot
Developed an AI-powered chatbot that provides personalized insights on stock analysis, crypto trends, and portfolio management.
Built an interactive web app using Streamlit, integrating conversational AI models for real-time financial Q&A.
Simplified complex financial concepts into user-friendly explanations, improving accessibility for students and beginner investors.
Applied interdisciplinary skills in AI, finance, and UI/UX design to create a functional and engaging tool.
SPY Forecasting using LSTM
Built a machine learning web app to predict obesity levels based on lifestyle & habit data
Compared Random Forest vs. XGBoost models for classification, selected Random Forest due to higher test accuracy (94.31% vs.
91.94%) and strong generalization.
Designed intuitive UI/UX to communicate predictions and probabilities integrated with FastAPI as backend
Obesity Level Prediction Web App
Built and trained an LSTM-based deep learning model to forecast SPY ETF price movements using historical time series data.
Designed complete pipeline: data collection, preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, and evaluation metrics.
Achieved strong predictive performance with: MSE: 0.0013, RMSE: 0.0362, MAE: 0.0261, R ²  Score: 0.8729.
